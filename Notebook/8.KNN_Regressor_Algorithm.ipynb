    "\n",
    "This is one of the simplest machine learning algorithm that attempts to determine the value of unknown points by the finding the average of near/close data points.  Its a nonparametric method since they do not make assumptions about the existing data in a dimension space, a common assumptions include that data is normally distributed. Given some training data, a KNN regressor attempts to place then into groups/clusters based on an attribute. Now when provided an unknown data point, we determine the GROUP its closest nearest neighbor is and assign that value.  "
