    "# LOGISTIC REGRESSION. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a supervied machine learning algorithm that aims at predicting a category or class an entity belongs to. Logistic regression is a classification problem that can take two forms ; binomial/binary classification where there are two classes or multinomial/multiclass where outputs are three or more classes. While regression problems have continous variable outputs (unbounded) , classification analysis have discrete outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of logistic regressions include : \n",
    "* Predicting whether an email is spam or not\n",
    "* image recognition , determine whether an image is a dog or human\n",
    "* predicting whether an employee will be promoted or not based on predioctors such as experience, education\n",
    "* determining credit scores \n",
    "* predicting whether a patient has heat disease or not\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid function has values are either 1 or 0 or others very close to them, this property makes it suitable for use in logistic resression analysis problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem formulation. \n",
    "In this tutorial we will see how this algorith is used to predict heart disease (dependent variable, 𝑦ᵢ) given a set of predictor features (independent variables, 𝐱ᵢ) for observations 𝑖 = 1, ...., n. Like linear regression we start with a set of known values of predictors 𝐱ᵢ for corressponding value 𝑦ᵢ given observations 𝑖 = 1, .... , n. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to find a function p(x) such that predictor input p(x) is a s close as possible to actual values of 𝑦ᵢ in each observations in 𝑖. Expected values are values close to 0 or 1(actual responses). Assuming that the mathematicl dependence between training data and useen data is unchanged, the function will easily predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a linear classifier that uses a function called `logit` : \n",
    "                \n",
    "                𝑓(𝐱) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥₁ + ⋯ + 𝑏ₙ𝑥ₙ u\n",
    "\n",
    "                𝑝(𝐱) = 1 / (1 + exp(−𝑓(𝐱))\n",
    "            \n",
    "* 𝑏₀ , 𝑏₁ and  𝑏ᵣ are estimators of the regression coefficient, also called predicted weights.\n",
    "* 𝑥₁ , 𝑥ₙ are predictor variables \n",
    "* 𝑝(𝐱) is the logistic function , which is the sigmoid function of 𝑓(𝐱)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This estimator optimises estimators/weights to ensure that predicted values are close to actual values using test dataset. This process is called model fitting. Once these values are found, a predicted value 𝑝(𝐱ᵢ) given an input 𝐱ᵢ can be determines easily. A threshold is set at 0.5 such that for each observation 𝑖, if value (𝑓(𝐱)) is 0.5 or greater predicted value is set to 1 ,else 0. Threshold is varied depending on use needs. So how do we end up with values 1 or 0, remember  𝑓(𝐱) is the logit function, where 𝑓(𝐱) = log(𝑝(𝐱) / (1 − 𝑝(𝐱))) . "
